# Lab Report 1

This is a tutorial of how to log into your course-specific account on ieng6. To do this, you must follow these steps:

## Step 1: Reset Your Course-Specific Account Password
* Look up your course-specific account for CSE 15L here: https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php
* Enter your UCSD username and PID number
* Click the button that says "cs15lsp23zz" (the zz will be different and unique to you)
* Click the link that says "Global Password Change Tool"
* Click the link that says "Proceed to the Password Change Tool"
* In the box that asks to enter your username, type your course specific one (cs15lsp23zz), NOT your UCSD username
* Click the link that says "I want to reset my course-specific account password"
* Verify the Duo Authentication
* Confirm your email address and click the link in your email that says "UC San Diego Password reset page"
* Follow the steps to reset your password


## Step 2: Install Visual Studio Code
* Go to the Visual Studio Code website https://code.visualstudio.com/, and follow the instructions to download and install it on your computer. There are versions for all the major operating systems, like macOS (for Macs) and Windows (for PCs)
* When it is installed, you should be able to open a window that looks like this (it might have different colors, or a different menu bar, depending on your system and settings):

## Step 3: Remotely Connect
In order to use Visual Studio Code or the terminal to connect to a remote computer over the Internet:
* Install [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/)
* Once installed, use the steps in [this post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42606837/how-do-i-use-bash-on-windows-from-the-visual-studio-code-integrated-terminal/50527994#50527994) to set your default terminal to use the newly-installed git bash in Visual Studio Code
* Then, to use ssh, open a new terminal in Visual Studio Code
* After the $ sign, type the command `ssh cs15lsp23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu` (the zz will be different and unique to you) 
* If this is the first time you've connected to this server, you will probably get a message like this: 
  ```
  The authenticity of host 'ieng6.ucsd.edu (128.54.70.227)' can't be established.
  RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:ksruYwhnYH+sySHnHAtLUHngrPEyZTDl/1x99wUQcec.
  Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? 
  ```
  This message is expected, so type yes and then press enter
  
* Enter your new password when prompted
* After you enter your password, you will now be on the remote server, and it should look something like this:

Your terminal is now connected to a computer in the CSE basement, and any commands you run will run on that computer. We call your computer the client and the computer in the basement the server based on how you are connected.


## Step 4: Run Some Commands
* Try running the commands cd, ls, pwd, mkdir, and cp a few times in different ways, both on your own computer and on the remote computer after ssh-ing
* Here are a few examples of commands on the remote computer:
