## Step 5: Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account

## Step 6: Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail
For this step, I changed to the lab7 directory by typing `cd l`, pressing `<tab>` to autocomplete it, and pressing `<enter>`. I then typed `ls` and `<enter>`
to list all the files/directories in lab7. Finally, I typed `bash t`, `<tab>` to autocomplete to `bash test.sh`, and pressed `<enter>`, which ran the tests.

## Step 7: Edit the code file to fix the failing test
For this step, I typed `vim L` and `<tab>` to autocomplete to `vim ListExamples`, then typed `.java` at the end, and finally pressed `<enter>`.

Next, the cursor was already on top of the `1` that I needed to change in ListExamples, so I simply typed `x` to delete the `1`.

I then pressed `i` to enter insert mode in Vim, and typed `2` to correct the error.
